Let's try 4 clusters

Attach cluster to dataset
```{r}

str(trucks)
```
Plots
```{r}
ggplot(trucks, aes(x=Distance,y=Speeding,color=factor(.cluster))) + geom_point() 
```

```{r}
trucks_scaled = scale(trucks) 
summary(trucks_scaled)
#scale works by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the entire variable, then scales each element by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation
